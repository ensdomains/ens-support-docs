# Custom records
You can add custom text records to your ENS name outside of the standard fields available. ENS records are infinitely extensible, meaning that there is no limit to the type and amount of text record data your ENS name can hold. 

## Service keys
Service keys are made up of a reverse dot notation sequence. For example, the ENS Manager App already has fields for common services. There are 5 default service keys for storing key-value data.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f5f6f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/custom-records-1.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

Service keys can be hierarchical. As an example, imagine the service key: 
com.example.shipping.vendor 

The text value for this record might reference a public API key specific to a shipping vendor of example.com.
