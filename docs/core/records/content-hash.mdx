# The Content record
One of the most interesting and powerful features of ENS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web. This is achieved by creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is entirely decentralized, meaning that neither is hosted on any one server.

## What does it do?
The Content record lets you point your ENS name to a decentralized resource. The location that record resolves to will allow a user to enter your ENS name into their browser's address bar and display your decentralized website.

:::info Compatible Browsers
For ENS resolution in the browser address bar to work, the browser needs to be compatible with ENS or have the Metamask extension installed.

### ENS Compatible browsers
Some browsers which are more oriented towards Web3 support ENS right out of the box:
 - <Link to="https://brave.com"><b>Brave Browser</b></Link>
 - <Link to="https://www.opera.com"><b>Opera Browser</b></Link>
 
Other browsers will need to have an extension installed for it to work, such as the Metamask browser extension:
 - <Link to="https://www.google.com/chrome"><b>Google Chrome</b></Link>
 - <Link to="https://www.mozilla.org"><b>Mozilla Firefox</b></Link>
