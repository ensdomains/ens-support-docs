# Social media records
The ENS Manager App contains several standard record fields which you can use to provide various social media and development accounts. Any amount of custom records can also be created.

| Service  | Record name    | Example username | Details                |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Discord  | `com.discord`  | *username#1234*  | Remove the leading `@` |
| Twitter  | `com.twitter`  | *username*       | Remove the leading `@` |
| GitHub   | `com.github`   | *username*       |                        |
| Reddit   | `com.reddit`   | *username*       |                        |
| Telegram | `org.telegram` | *username*       |                        |

:::caution Note
**These services do not yet have ENS integration, so changing the records will only affect certain custom services that look this information up.**

## Changing my Twitter name
Twitter does not *yet* have ENS integration, so to change your Twitter name to display your ENS name you'd simply go to your profile and change your name to your ENS name.

:::

## Changing my Discord name
ENS provides a Discord record: `com.discord` which can be used to provide your Discord username to anyone who looks up your ENS name. An example use case is to verify that the ENS name is owned by a specific Discord user.

To set it, enter your username excluding the *@* but including the digits at the end. For example `User#1234`
