# Bug Bounty Program

The ENS bug bounty program rewards anyone who finds a bug in covered ENS smart contracts.

## Rules and Rewards

- Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to ENS Labs Limited are not eligible for bounty rewards.
- Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. This includes exploiting the bug on mainnet or any public test network.
- Contractors of ENS Labs Limited, employees and all other people paid by the ENS project directly are not eligible for rewards.
- Only the smart contracts listed below are eligible for rewards. Websites and other infrastructure are not covered by the bounty program.
- The ENS bounty program considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of ENS Labs Limited.

:::info OWASP Risk Rating Model

The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on `Severity`. The severity is calculated according to the **OWASP Risk Rating Model** based on `Impact` and `Likelihood`:

:::caution Reservation of Rights
ENS Labs Limited reserves the right to adjust bounty amounts at any time in the future.
:::

Where the contract in our GitHub repository differs from the one deployed on Ethereum, due to changes having been made since the last deployment, the following rules apply:

:::info Rules and Considerations
1. **If the bug exists in the contract deployed on Ethereum**  
The full bounty amount is payable.
1. **If the bug is only in the version on GitHub**  
ENS Labs Limited will decide at its discretion an appropriate proportion of the bounty to award based on the state of the code (from 0% for code that was never intended to be deployed, to 100% for code that is considered final).

In addition to `Severity`, other variables are also considered when ENS Labs Limited decides the score,  
including _(but not limited to)_:

- **Quality of Description**  
Higher rewards are paid for clear, well-written submissions.
- **Quality of Reproducibility**  
Please include test code, scripts and detailed instructions. The easier it is for us to reproduce and verify the vulnerability, the higher the reward.
- **Quality of Fix**  
If included. Higher rewards are paid for submissions with clear description of how to fix the issue.

:::info Covered contracts
