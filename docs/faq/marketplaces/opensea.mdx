# OpenSea
OpenSea is a third-party marketplace run by a separate private company and is unaffiliated with Ethereum Name Service, as such we don't have any access to their systems to fix problems that are isolated to their platform.

## ENS name doesn't show
While ENS names appear and start working immediately in the ENS app, it can sometimes take a much longer time for them to show on third-party marketplaces because they only update their internal databases every once in a while.

When you're experiencing this issue the ENS names will show up either as a series of digits or as "Unknown ENS name".

:::info Fix
To fix this refresh the metadata:
 - [**OpenSea:** Refresh Metadata](#refresh-metadata)
:::

This schedules a refresh of the metadata in OpenSea's internal databases and usually resolves the issue in the next few hours.

:::caution if it doesn't work
If the ENS name still doesn't show up correctly after 24 hours you need to contact OpenSea's support for assistance:
 - [**OpenSea:** Support](#support)
:::

## OpenSea shows a "Delisted" notice
If the name does not exist at all on OpenSea, you will need to reach out to their [#Support](#support) to inquire why.

## OpenSea does not allow the name to be listed or sold
Be sure your name has a valid expiration date. ENS names that have expired are not able to be transferred (sold), or have any of their records updated.

:::info Fix
Extend the name's registration in the ENS Manager App:
 - [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).
:::

## I'm not listed as the owner of my name
If you find that your name shows up on OpenSea, but with someone else as the owner (or without an owner at all)
then you'll need to refresh the name metadata on OpenSea.
