## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I set my ENS name as my username on Twitter?
Twitter hasn't yet integrated support for ENS names, so you'd simply type them in as your profile name.

### Why are only some ENS names selectable as NFT Profile Pictures?

Twitter Blue recently rolled out support for NFT avatar's in their iOS apps.
This feature is in a _beta phase_ and currently only supports NFT's linking to `.png` and `.jpg` `.jpeg` images.
    
In the old metadata service operated by OpenSea `.png` images were rendered for ENS names. These are the names you see in various colours.

In the new metadata service all names now show up with a blue background with a more modern design.

In ENS new metadata service `.svg` (vector) images are rendered for previews with a rasterization end-point for `.png` images.

Since Twitter grabs their NFT metadata from OpenSea instead of from ENS Metadata service, the rasterization end-point isn't used, so only
ENS names that still has cached metadata from _OpenSea's Metadata Service_ are selectable.
