# Secondary markets
After purchasing an ENS name from a secondary marketplace it's important to keep a few things in mind:

 * The registration period is *inherited* from the previous owner, so double-check the expiration date using the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).
  
 * *Only* the `Owner` record is updated with your wallet address, all other records like the `Manager` and `ETH Address` records remain set to the old owner's address until you change it.

:::warning
Without updating the ETH Address, sending tokens to a name you've just purchased on a secondary market will most likely lead to a loss of funds. Be sure 
the ENS name is not still be pointing to the previous owner's wallet address.
