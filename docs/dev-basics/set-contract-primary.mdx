# Set Primary Name For Contract

For most regular wallet accounts, you can just use the ENS Manager App to set the <Link to="/core/records/primary-name">Primary Name</Link>. Even if your address is technically a contract account, you may still be able to use the app to do this, if the contract allows arbitrary transactions (e.g. <Link to="https://safe.global/">Gnosis Safe</Link>).

See here for a how-to guide for the Manager App: <Link to="/howto/set-primary-name">Set a Primary Name</Link>

Otherwise, see below for additional methods.

## Existing contracts

If your contract has already been deployed, and it doesn't have any built-in methods to set its own primary name, then you may still be able to set it by other means, if:

* Your contract inherits the <Link to="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol">Ownable</Link> module, and you are the owner

Or:

* You are an approved operator for the contract in the ENS Registry.

### Using Set Primary Tool

This is a small helper website we built on the side to address some edge-cases that may not make sense for the ENS Manager App (or are still on the roadmap):

<BrowserWindow url="https://tools.ens.domains/setprimary/">
  <div style={{'background':'#F7F7F7'}}>
    <iframe src="https://tools.ens.domains/setprimary#embedded" width="100%" height="600px"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

### Using the contract directly

You can interact directly with the Reverse Registrar contract on Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa58e81fe9b61b5c3fe2afd33cf304c454abfc7cb#writeContract#F8

<BrowserWindow url="etherscan.io">
  <Image img="/img/etherscan-connect-wallet.jpg"/>
</BrowserWindow>

At the top, click on "Connect to Web3" to connect your wallet. Then scroll down and expand the `setNameForAddr` method:

<BrowserWindow url="etherscan.io">
  <Image img="/img/set-contract-primary-name1.jpg"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Enter the four fields:
 - **addr:** The contract address you are setting the primary name for.
 - **owner:** The owner of the reverse node in the ENS Registry. Enter your address.
 - **resolver:** The resolver to use for the reverse node. Enter the default Public Resolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`
 - **name:** The primary name to set for the contract. This must be a name that already <Link to="/core/records/eth-address">forward-resolves</Link> to the contract address, otherwise Primary Name resolution will not work.

Then click on "Write" to send the transaction to your wallet.

## New Contracts

If you a developing a new contract, and you want to be able to easily set the ENS Primary Name for it, then you can include this module: <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseClaimer.sol">ReverseClaimer.sol</Link>

Also include the interface for the core ENS registry: <Link to="https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/registry/ENS.sol">ENS.sol</Link>

Make sure your contract inherits ReverseClaimer:

```
contract MyContract is ReverseClaimer {
  ...
}
```

Then call it in your constructor:

```
constructor (
  ENS ens,
  ...
) ReverseClaimer(ens, msg.sender) {
  ...
}
```

When you deploy that contract, it will automatically claim the reverse node for that contract address for you.

Then, use the <Link to="#using-set-primary-tool">tool above</Link> to set the Primary Name whenever you want.

If you want to do it manually via the contract, see below.

## When you already own the reverse node

If you already own the reverse node for a particular address, then you can update the Primary Name at any time.

The "reverse node" is the <Link to="/dev-basics/namehash#generating-a-namehash">namehash</Link> for `<addr>.addr.reverse`, where `<addr>` is the address (all lowercase, and remove the `0x`).

Example for address `0x481f50a5BdcCC0bc4322C4dca04301433dED50f0`
* `namehash('481f50a5bdccc0bc4322c4dca04301433ded50f0.addr.reverse')`
* `0x58354ffdde6ac279f3a058aafbeeb14059bcb323a248fb338ee41f95fa544c86`

First, make sure a resolver is set on the reverse node: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000c2e074ec69a0dfb2997ba6c7d2e1e#readContract#F5

If none is set, set the resolver to the default Public Resolver (`0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`): https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000c2e074ec69a0dfb2997ba6c7d2e1e#writeContract#F4

<BrowserWindow url="etherscan.io">
  <Image img="/img/set-contract-primary-name2.jpg"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Then, call `setName` on the resolver:

<BrowserWindow url="etherscan.io">
  <Image img="/img/set-contract-primary-name3.jpg"/>
</BrowserWindow>
