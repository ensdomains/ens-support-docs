# Transfer an ENS name (V3)

:::info
 1. **Owner:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*
 1. **Manager:** *The manager of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*

When transferring an ENS name, only the `Owner` record is automatically updated to reflect the new owner wallet.
Depending on your specific use-case it's therefore a good idea to take a moment and think about what additional records you want to transfer.

## Completely transfer a name
If you want to completely transfer a name to a wallet you'll need to set three records to the new wallet in a specific order because only the wallet set as `Manager` is allowed to change the `ETH Address`.
:::info For example
 - If you were to change `Manager` first, you wouldn't be able to set the `ETH Address` without switching to the new wallet.
:::

In order to set everything to the new wallet easily from the wallet that currently owns the ENS name, you'd follow this specific order:

:::info Order
 1. **ETH Address:** *The wallet address the ENS name points to, where funds sent to it will arrive.*
 1. **Manager:** *The manager of records, the wallet allowed to make changes to its records (but not transfer the name)*
 1. **Owner:** *The owner of the ENS name, the wallet the ENS name NFT resides in.*

### Go to the Manager App
Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> with the wallet set as `Owner` & `Manager` for the ENS name you want to manage and click `Names` to bring up a list
of your ENS names *or* search for an ENS name you own directly from the main page.

</BrowserWindow>

Click `Send`.

When sending a name you have the optional ability to set the recipient as `Manager` of the ENS name.
:::info
1. `Owner` *The owner can send to a new owner and change the manager*
1. `Manager` *The manager can change and set records*
:::

Toggle the suitable options and click `Next`.

## Gift a Name with ENSFairy
If you would like to register a name on behalf of another wallet, <Link to="https://ensfairy.xyz"><b>ENSFairy</b></Link> is a great way to do that. This is because you can register a name with one wallet, but set up the ownership and address records to point to a different wallet.
