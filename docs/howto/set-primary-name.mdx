# Set a Primary name
The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your ENS name, helping decentralized apps and services display your ENS name based on your *Ethereum* wallet address.

In this guide we'll show you how to set up your Primary Name.

Setting a name as `Primary` in your wallet is usually a simple affair, but it can be a little complicated if:
 - **The name was registered using a third-party service that didn't set the `Resolver` and `ETH Address` records by default.**
 - **The name was purchased on a secondary market and the `ETH Address` record is still set to the previous owner's wallet.**

If either of these applies to you, then you can solve it by following the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

## Prerequisites
In order to set an ENS name as `Primary` there are two prerequisites:
1. **The Resolver record must be set to the `ENS Public Resolver` smart contract.**
1. **The `ETH Address` record must be set to the wallet you're setting the `Primary` on.**

### 1. Set the **Resolver** {#set-the-resolver}

<details>
<summary>Set the Resolver Record</summary>

Go to your ENS name in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and click the `More`-tab.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-resolver-1.png"/>

On the `More`-tab make sure that the `Resolver` record there is set to either of these contract addresses:

:::info
 - The **new** ENS Public Resolver contract: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`
 - The **old** ENS Public Resolver contract: `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`  
   _the old ENS Public Resolver contract will continue to work and should not cause any issues._
:::

If it's not set to one of the addresses above, click the `Edit`-button next to the Resolver.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-resolver-2.png"/>

Select `Use Latest Resolver` and click `Update` and then approve the transaction in your wallet.

</details>

### 2. Set the **ETH Address**-record {#set-the-eth-address-record}

<details>
<summary>Set the ETH Address record</summary>

Go to the <Link to="https://app.ens.domains"><b>ENS Manager App</b></Link> with the wallet set as `Manager` for the ENS name you want to manage and click `Names` to bring up a list
of your ENS names *or* search for an ENS name you own directly from the main page.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-1.png"/>

Click the ENS name you want to add records to.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-2.png"/>

Go to the `Records` tab
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-3.png"/>

Click `Edit Records`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-4.png"/>

Switch to the `Address` tab
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-5.png"/>

Click `Add Address`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-6.png"/>

</details>

## Set the Primary name
Click the ENS name you want to set as `Primary` in your wallet.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" bg="#f3f4f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-primary-name-2.png"/>

Click `Set as Primary name`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.ens.domains" bg="#f3f4f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-primary-name-3.png"/>

:::tip
If your ENS name doesn't show up in the Primary drop-down list, it's usually because the ENS name's `ETH Address` record doesn't point to your ENS name. To resolve it, see
